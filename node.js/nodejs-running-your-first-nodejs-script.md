> **Goal**: Learn how to run JavaScript code *outside* the browser for the first time, using Node.js!

---

## üöÄ Quick Introduction

When you first learned about JavaScript, you probably ran it **inside** a browser ‚Äî maybe using the **Console** in Chrome or Firefox DevTools.  
**But JavaScript isn't just for browsers anymore!**

Thanks to **Node.js**, you can run JavaScript **directly on your computer**, outside of any browser.  
This is super important because Node.js powers real-world servers, apps, tools, and even AI projects!

---

## üß† Key Concept

- **Browsers** (like Chrome) have a JavaScript engine (like **V8**) that understands and runs JS code.
- **Node.js** uses that same engine ‚Äî **without the browser!**  
- This means you can write and run backend servers, automation scripts, and real applications just with JavaScript.

## üõ†Ô∏è Let's Get Practical: Your First Node Script

### Step 1: Install Node.js

- Download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and install it.
- After installing, check it‚Äôs ready by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing:

  ```bash
  node --version
  ```

  You should see something like `v20.11.1` (or newer).

---

### Step 2: Create Your First JavaScript File

- Open any folder.
- Create a new file called:  

  ```plaintext
  hello.js
  ```

- Inside `hello.js`, write this code:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello Node!');
  ```

---

### Step 3: Run It with Node.js

In your terminal or command prompt:

1. Navigate to the folder where your `hello.js` file is saved:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node hello.js
   ```

‚úÖ If everything is correct, you should see:

```bash
Hello Node!
```

printed in your terminal!

---

## üìù Why This Matters

- You're not limited to browser popups or HTML pages anymore.
- Node.js gives you **superpowers**: you can build web servers, APIs, apps, and powerful tools.
- Learning Node.js is a gateway to becoming a **full-stack developer**!

 üéØ Quick Practice Exercise (Mini Exam)

**Task**:

1. Create a file called `greeting.js`.
2. Write a script that prints:

   ```javascript
   Welcome to the world of Node.js!
   ```

   to the terminal.

3. Run the script using Node.js.

***Bonus Challenge***

After your greeting, also print today's date!

Hint:

```javascript
console.log(new Date());
```

***Remember***

Every great developer once started by typing:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```

You‚Äôre on your way! üöÄ
