TypeScript has become the go-to language for modern web development, offering a powerful type system that enhances JavaScript with static typing. But did you know that TypeScript has built-in utility types that can make your code cleaner, more readable, and maintainable?
In this blog post, we'll explore some essential TypeScript utility types, understand how they work, and learn how to use them effectively in real-world applications.

What Are TypeScript Utility Types?
When working with TypeScript, developers often write repetitive code to manipulate types. This is where utility types come in. Utility types are built-in TypeScript helpers that allow you to transform and refine types more efficiently, reducing redundancy and improving code maintainability.
Instead of manually modifying type structures, you can leverage these utilities to create cleaner, more expressive definitions. Whether you need to make properties optional, exclude specific keys, or extract certain parts of a type, TypeScript utility types streamline these operations.
This section will explore some of the most helpful utility types, explain their practical applications, and show how they can enhance your TypeScript workflow. Let's dive in!

1. Partial< T > – Make All Properties Optional
In TypeScript, the `Partial<T>` utility type is used to create a new kind in which all properties of `T` are optional. This is especially useful when working with objects where some properties may not always be needed.  

#### **How It Works**  

The `Partial<T>` utility constructs a type by iterating over each property in `T` and making it optional. Internally, it is defined as:  

"`typescript
type Partial< T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};

This means every property in `T` gets transformed into an optional property (`?`).  

#### **Example Usage**  

Consider a `User` type that requires all properties:  

"`typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

Now, if we want to create an object that only updates some of these properties, we can use `Partial<User>`:  

"`typescript
function updateUser(user: User, updates: Partial< User>): User {
  return { ...user, ...updates };
}

const user: User = { id: 1, name: "Alice", email: "<alice@example.com>"};

// We can now update only specific properties
const updatedUser = updateUser(user, { name: "Bob" });

console.log(updatedUser);
// Output: { id: 1, name: "Bob", email: "<alice@example.com>"}

 Why Use `Partial<T>`?**  
-Flexibility:** You can pass objects with only a subset of properties.  
-Convenience: Reduces the need to define multiple interfaces for optional variations of an object.  
-Improved Type Safety:** TypeScript ensures that the partial object still adheres to the original type structure.  

By using `Partial<T>`, we can handle optional properties clean and type-safe, making our TypeScript code more robust and maintainable.

2.Required< T> – Make All Properties Required
In TypeScript, the `Required<T>` utility type ensures that all properties of a given type `T` are mandatory. This is particularly useful when working with objects that might have optional properties, but you need to enforce strict completeness in specific contexts.  

How It Works  
The `Required<T>` utility type takes an object type `T` and transforms all its optional properties into required ones. It does this by leveraging TypeScript's mapped types and the `-?` operator, which removes the optional (`?`) modifier from each property.  

"`typescript
type Required< T> = {
  [P in keyof T]-?: T[P];
};

Example Usage**  

Consider a scenario where we have a `User` type with optional properties:  

"`typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
}

By applying `Required<T>`, we make all properties mandatory:  

"`typescript
type FullUser = Required< User>;

const user: FullUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  email: " alice@example. com ",
}; // ✅ All properties are required

#### **Use Cases**  

- **Ensuring Data Completeness**: When working with APIs or forms, you may need to guarantee that an object has all properties filled before processing.  
- **Type-Safe Defaults**: If you're merging default values into an object, `Required<T>` can ensure all fields exist.  
- **Refining Partial Types**: Convert partially defined objects back into fully populated ones when needed.  

By using `Required<T>`, you gain stricter type enforcement, making your TypeScript code more robust and predictable.

3.Readonly< T> – Prevent Modification of Properties
In TypeScript, the `Readonly<T>` utility type is used to make all properties of an object immutable, meaning they cannot be reassigned after initialization. This is particularly useful to enforce immutability and prevent accidental object modification.  

#### **Usage**  

The `Readonly<T>` utility takes a generic type `T` and returns a new type where all properties of `T` are read-only:  

"`typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

const user: Readonly< User> = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice"
};

// Compilation Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
user.name = "Bob";

In this example, attempting to modify the `name` property of the `user` object results in a TypeScript compilation error, ensuring the object remains immutable.  

#### **When to Use `Readonly<T>`**  

- **Ensuring Data Integrity**: Use `Readonly<T>` to prevent accidental modifications of objects that should remain unchanged throughout the program.  
- **Enhancing Maintainability**: Immutability makes code easier to reason about and reduces potential side effects.  
- **Working with Functional Programming**: When following functional programming principles, immutability is key, and `Readonly<T>` helps enforce it.  

#### **Readonly vs. Const**  

While `const` prevents reassignment of variables, it does not make object properties immutable:  

```typescript
const user2: User = { id: 2, name: "Charlie" };
user2.name = "Dave"; // This is allowed

const readonlyUser: Readonly<User> = { id: 3, name: "Eve" };
readonlyUser.name = "Frank"; // Error: Readonly property
```

Using `Readonly<T>` ensures that even properties within an object remain unchanged, making it a valuable tool for enforcing immutability at the type level.

4.`Pick<T, K>` – Select Specific Properties
In TypeScript, the `Pick<T, K>` utility type allows you to create a new kind by selecting specific properties from an existing type `T`. This is useful when you only need a subset of a type's properties, ensuring better type safety and maintainability.

#### **Syntax**

"`typescript
type Pick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
  [P in K]: T[P];
};

Here's how it works:
-`T` represents the original type.
-`K extends keyof T` ensures that `K` is a valid key from `T`.
-The resulting type includes only the properties in `K`, preserving their types.

Example Usage**
"`typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

type BasicUserInfo = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;

const user: BasicUserInfo = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  // email: "alice@example. com", ❌ Error: Property 'email' does not exist on type 'BasicUserInfo'
};

In this example, `BasicUserInfo` only contains `id` and `name` from `User`, preventing access to `email` and `isAdmin`.

Use Cases**

- **API Responses**: When returning a simplified version of an object without exposing sensitive or unnecessary data.
- **Component Props**: When passing only the required properties to a UI component.
- **Data Transformations**: When mapping or filtering objects dynamically while maintaining type safety.

#### **Conclusion**

`Pick<T, K>` is a powerful tool in TypeScript for refining types and ensuring only the necessary properties are included. It enhances code maintainability by reducing unnecessary fields and making types more manageable and explicit.

5.Omit<T, K> – Remove Specific Properties
In TypeScript, the `Omit<T, K>` utility type allows us to create a new kind by excluding one or more properties from an existing type `T`. This is particularly useful when we need a modified version of an object type without specific fields.  

Syntax**  

```typescript
type NewType = Omit<OriginalType, 'propertyToRemove'>;
```

Example Usage**  

Consider a `User` type that contains several properties:  

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
};
```

If we need a version of `User` that excludes the `password` field—such as when returning public user data—we can use `Omit`:  

```typescript
type PublicUser = Omit<User, 'password'>;

const user: PublicUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  // password is omitted and will cause an error if included
};
```

#### **Omitting Multiple Properties**  

We can also remove multiple properties by passing a union type (`|`) as the second argument:  

```typescript
type UserWithoutSensitiveInfo = Omit<User, 'password' | 'email'>;

const limitedUser: UserWithoutSensitiveInfo = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice',
  // email and password are omitted
};
```

Use Cases**  

- Creating safer data models for frontend display, excluding sensitive information.  
- Modifying existing types without redefining them manually.  
- Enhancing type safety by explicitly preventing access to certain fields.  

By using `Omit<T, K>`, we can work with refined versions of types while maintaining flexibility and type safety in our applications.

 6.`Record<K, T>` – Create an Object Type with Specific Keys
In the world of TypeScript, one of the most potent utility types is `Record<K, T>`. It allows you to define an object with a set of specific keys and values that follow a particular type. This helps ensure that your objects are structured predictably and reliably, making your code cleaner, more readable, and less error-prone.

#### What is `Record<K, T>`?

The `Record<K, T>` utility type is used to create an object type with keys of type `K` and values of type `T`. The key `K` is typically a union type of string literals (but can also be other types, such as `number` or `symbol`), and the value `T` is the type of values each key can have.

Here's the basic syntax:

```typescript
type Record<K extends string | number | symbol, T> = {
    [P in K]: T;
};
```

This creates a new type where the keys are constrained by `K`, and all values for those keys are of type `T`.

#### Why Use `Record<K, T>`?

The `Record<K, T>` type is beneficial for defining object shapes where you know the keys the object will have and what kind of value each key should hold. It ensures consistency and helps with autocompletion, type checking, and error prevention.

#### Example: Mapping Specific Keys to Values

Imagine you're working with predefined colors and want to map each color name to its corresponding hex code. Instead of using a generic object type, you can leverage `Record` for more type safety:

```typescript
type ColorHexCodes = Record<'red' | 'green' | 'blue', string>;

const colors: ColorHexCodes = {
    red: '#FF0000',
    green: '#00FF00',
    blue: '#0000FF'
};
```

Here, `Record<'red' | 'green' | 'blue', string>` ensures that the object `colors` can only have the keys `red`, `green`, and `blue`, and all values must be strings (representing hex codes).

#### Enforcing Specific Keys

If you try to add a key that’s not part of the union type `'red' | 'green' | 'blue'`, TypeScript will throw an error, protecting you from incorrect data:

```typescript
colors.yellow = '#FFFF00'; // Error: Property 'yellow' does not exist on type 'ColorHexCodes'
```

#### Use Cases for `Record<K, T>`

1. **Configuration Objects**: When you need a fixed set of configuration options, `Record<K, T>` ensures all the required keys are present and correctly typed.
2. **Dictionary or Map-Like Structures**: If you're building a dictionary or a map where each key maps to a specific value type, `Record` is the go-to solution.
3. **Enum-Like Mappings**: When creating a set of mappings from a specific key to a value (like mapping string literals to particular data types), `Record` provides clarity and consistency.

#### Conclusion

The `Record<K, T>` utility type is an essential tool in TypeScript for creating well-structured, predictable objects. Defining specific keys and ensuring type safety for values helps maintain cleaner and more maintainable code. So, next time you're dealing with a fixed set of keys and values, don’t hesitate to use `Record` for that extra layer of type safety!

7.Exclude<T, U> – Remove Union Members
The `Exclude<T, U>` utility type in TypeScript is used to construct a new type by removing all members of one type (represented by `U`) of another kind (`T`). This is particularly useful when working with union types; you need to exclude specific values or types from the union.

#### **How It Works:**

- **`T`** represents the source type, which could be a union of multiple types.
- **`U`** represents the type you want to exclude from `T`.

The result is a new type where all occurrences of `U` within `T` are removed. This conditional type uses TypeScript’s mapped types and conditional types under the hood to filter out unwanted members.

#### **Example Usage:**

```typescript
type A = string | number | boolean;
type B = number | boolean;

type Result = Exclude<A, B>;
// Result is now 'string', because 'number' and 'boolean' are excluded from A
```

In the example above, `A` is a union of `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. We want to exclude `number` and `boolean` from `A`, so using `Exclude<A, B>`, the result is a new type that consists only of `string`.

#### **Key Points:**

- The `Exclude<T, U>` type is essentially a way to subtract certain types from a union.
- It’s especially useful when working with types that overlap or when you want to refine union types for more specific use cases.

#### **Practical Scenario:**

Suppose you are working with a function that accepts a union of various event types, but you want to ensure that a specific event type is excluded from the options:

```typescript
type EventTypes = 'click' | 'hover' | 'keydown' | 'focus';
type ExcludedEventTypes = 'keydown' | 'focus';

type FilteredEventTypes = Exclude<EventTypes, ExcludedEventTypes>;
// FilteredEventTypes will be 'click' | 'hover'
```

Here, `FilteredEventTypes` contains only `click` and `hover`, because `keydown` and `focus` have been excluded.

#### **Conclusion:**

`Exclude<T, U>` is a simple but powerful utility for refining types in TypeScript by removing unwanted members from union types. It makes type manipulation more expressive and ensures that only the relevant types remain.

This should give you a concise understanding of how `Exclude<T, U>` works and how to use it in your TypeScript projects!

8.Extract<T, U> – Keep Only Specific Union Members
In TypeScript, the utility type `Extract<T, U>` is designed to help developers filter union types by retaining only the members that are assignable to a specific type `U`. This is particularly useful when you want to narrow down a union to a subset of values that match a given type, making the type system more precise and enhancing code safety.

#### How it works

The `Extract<T, U>` type constructs a new type that includes only those members from `T` that are assignable to `U`. It essentially filters the union `T` to retain only the types that are compatible with `U`. If no members are compatible, the result will be `never`.

#### Syntax

```typescript
Extract<T, U>
```

- **T**: The union type that contains the elements to filter.
- **U**: The type to match against.

#### Example

Consider a scenario in which we have a union type with different values and want to keep only the members who match a specific type.

```typescript
type Animal = "dog" | "cat" | "bird" | "fish";
type Mammal = "dog" | "cat";

// Keep only the types of Animal that are also Mammal
type MammalAnimal = Extract<Animal, Mammal>;
// Result: "dog" | "cat"
```

In this example:

- The `Animal` type is a union of various animals, including "dog," "cat," "bird," and "fish."
- The `Mammal` type includes only "dog" and "cat."
- The `Extract<Animal, Mammal>` type results in a new type that includes only the types "dog" and "cat," since they are the ones present in both `Animal` and `Mammal`.

#### Use Cases

1. **Type Narrowing**: If you have a union of types and want to extract the ones that match a specific criterion, `Extract` allows you to narrow down the possibilities. This is particularly helpful in cases where you're working with a broad set of types but need to operate only on a subset.

2. **Union Type Filtering**: Union types can grow large and diverse in larger systems. By using `Extract`, you can safely and efficiently extract types that match a certain shape or category, simplifying your logic.

3. **Type Safety in Functions**: When writing functions that work with union types, using `Extract` can help ensure that your function only processes specific types, reducing runtime errors and improving code clarity.

Conclusion

The `Extract<T, U>` utility is a powerful tool for filtering union types in TypeScript's type system. Extracting only those compatible with a given type allows you to write more specific, maintainable, and type-safe code. Whether for narrowing down types or ensuring type safety across complex type structures, `Extract` is a key tool to have in your TypeScript toolkit.

9.NonNullable< T> – Remove null and undefined
TypeScript’s type system allows `null` and `undefined` to be part of many types. However, in some instances, you may want to guarantee that a value is neither `null` nor `undefined`. The `NonNullable<T>` type is designed for this purpose.

### Example Usage

```typescript
type Example = string | null | undefined;
type CleanedExample = NonNullable<Example>;

// CleanedExample is now just 'string', because null and undefined have been excluded.
```

In the above example, `Example` could be a `string`, `null`, or `undefined`. By using `NonNullable`, we create a new type `CleanedExample`, which only allows a `string`, removing both `null` and `undefined`.

### When to Use `NonNullable<T>`

- **Type Narrowing**: To ensure a value is strictly defined and cannot be `null` or `undefined`.
- **Function Arguments**: When a function expects a parameter that must not be `null` or `undefined`, you want to enforce this at compile time.
- **Type Safety**: To ensure that a value passed through your system is always a valid, non-null value, helping to avoid runtime errors associated with `null` or `undefined`.

### Key Takeaways

- `NonNullable<T>` removes both `null` and `undefined` from a type.
- It can help enforce stricter types and prevent runtime errors in TypeScript.
- It's a simple, effective way to ensure your code handles only defined values.

By using `NonNullable<T>`, you can ensure that your types are as precise and predictable as possible, improving the overall reliability of your TypeScript code.
