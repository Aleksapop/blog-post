 One of the core features that makes TypeScript so valuable is its strong typing system. In this guide, we’ll explore TypeScript variables and data types in detail, helping you understand how to declare variables properly and make the most of TypeScript’s type system.
Whether you are a beginner or an experienced JavaScript developer, mastering TypeScript’s variables and data types will significantly improve your coding skills and efficiency.

1. Declaring Variables in TypeScript

In TypeScript, variable declaration follows the principles of JavaScript while introducing type annotations to enhance code reliability and maintainability. You can declare variables using `let`, `const`, or `var`, though `let` and `const` are preferred due to their block-scoping behavior.  

### Using `let` and `const`  

- `let` allows reassignment but is block-scoped:  
  “`typescript
  let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
  message = "Updated message"; // Valid

- `const` creates immutable bindings, ensuring values cannot be reassigned:  

  “`typescript
  const pi: number = 3.14159;
  // pi = 3.14; // Error: Cannot assign to ‘pi’ because it is a constant.

Type Annotations  

TypeScript enables explicit type annotations, improving code clarity and preventing unintended type assignments:  
“`typescript
let count: number = 10;
let isActive: boolean = true;
let username: string = "JohnDoe";

Type Inference  
If a variable is initialized without an explicit type, TypeScript infers its type automatically:  
“`typescript
let greeting = "Hello"; // Inferred as 'string'
let age = 25; // Inferred as 'number'

### `var` (Legacy, Avoid Using)  

While `var` is still valid in TypeScript, it has function-scoping issues that `let` and `const` address:  
“`typescript
var legacyVar = "Avoid using var"; // Function-scoped

2.TypeScript Data Types
TypeScript extends JavaScript by introducing static types, enabling developers to catch errors early and improve code maintainability. Understanding TypeScript’s built-in data types is fundamental to leveraging its full potential.  

1.Primitive Types
TypeScript includes all of JavaScript’s primitive types but enforces stricter type safety:  

- **`string`** – Represents text values.  
  “`ts
  let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";

- **`number`** – Represents both integers and floating-point values.  
  “`ts
  let count: number = 42;
  let price: number = 99.99;
- **`boolean`** – Represents `true` or `false` values.  

  “`ts
  let isActive: boolean = true;

#### **2. Special Types**  

- **`null`** and **`undefined`** – Represent absence of values. By default, they are subtypes of all types unless `strictNullChecks` is enabled.  
  “`ts
  let empty: null = null;
  let notAssigned: undefined = undefined;

- **`any`** – Disables type checking, allowing variables to hold values of any type.  

  “`ts
  let dynamicVar: any = "Can be anything";
  dynamicVar = 42; // No error

- **`unknown`** – Similar to `any`, but requires type checking before usage.  

  “`ts
  let uncertain: unknown = "Might be anything";
  if (typeof uncertain === "string") {
    console.log(uncertain.toUpperCase());
  }

#### **3. Complex Types**  

- **`array`** – Represents a collection of values of the same type.  
  “`ts
  let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
  let words: Array<[string>](https://)= [“apple”, “banana”];

- **`tuple`** – Represents an array with fixed-length and specific types.  

  “`ts
  let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];

- **`enum`** – Defines a set of named constants.  

  “`ts
  enum Status {
    Active,
    Inactive,
    Pending
  }
  let userStatus: Status = Status.Active;

#### **4. Object Types**  

- **`object`** – Represents non-primitive values.  
  “`ts
  let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
    name: “John”,
    age: 25
  };

- **`interface`** – Defines a structure for objects.  

  “`ts
  interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }
  let user: User = { name: “Sarah”, age: 28 };

#### **5. Function Types**  

TypeScript allows specifying function return types and parameter types.  
“`ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

6.Union and Intersection Types
-Union (`|`)** – Allows a variable to hold multiple types.  
  “`ts
  let identifier: number | string = 123;
  identifier = "ABC"; // Valid

-Intersection (`&`)** – Combines multiple types into one.  
  “`ts
  interface Admin {
    role: string;
  }
  interface Employee {
    name: string;
  }
  let manager: Admin & Employee = { name: “Alice”, role: “Manager”};

3.Type Inference
TypeScript employs **type inference** to determine the type of a variable when no explicit type annotation is provided. This feature enhances developer productivity by reducing the need for redundant type declarations while still maintaining strong type safety.  

#### **3.1 How Type Inference Works**  

When a variable is declared and assigned a value in TypeScript, the compiler automatically infers its type based on the assigned value. This inferred type persists throughout the variable’s lifecycle, ensuring only compatible values can be assigned.  

For example:  

“`typescript
let message = "Hello, TypeScript!";
// message is inferred as type string

let count = 42;
// count is inferred as type number

let isActive = true;
// isActive is inferred as type boolean

TypeScript determines the types (`string`, `number`, and `boolean`) without explicit annotations. This prevents accidental assignments that violate the inferred type:  

“`typescript
count = “forty-two”; // Error: Type ‘string’ is not assignable to type ‘number’

3.2 Best Common Type Inference**  

TypeScript uses the **best common type** rule when inferring types for an array with multiple values. It evaluates all elements and determines a general type that accommodates them:  

“`typescript
let values = [1, 2, 3, 4];
// values is inferred as number[]

let mixedValues = [1, “two”, 3];
// mixedValues is inferred as (string | number)[]

If elements belong to different types, TypeScript infers a **union type**, allowing only those specific types in further assignments.  

3.3 Contextual Typing**  
TypeScript also applies **contextual typing** (also known as **implicit Inference from context**) based on surrounding code structures, such as function arguments and return values:  

“`typescript
window.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log(event.clientX, event.clientY);
});

In the above example, TypeScript infers that `event` is of type `MouseEvent` based on the `“click”` event context. This enables intelligent autocompletion and type safety without requiring explicit annotations.  

#### **3.4 When to Use Explicit Types**  

While type inference reduces the need for explicit annotations, there are cases where explicitly declaring types is beneficial:  

- When defining complex objects or function return types  
- When working with APIs where inferred types might not be accurate  
- When enforcing stricter type constraints for clarity and maintainability  

Example:  

“`typescript
function multiply(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a * b; // Explicit return type ensures clarity
}

By leveraging TypeScript’s inference capabilities while strategically using explicit annotations, developers can write concise, readable, and type-safe code.

4.Type Assertions (Type Casting)
TypeScript allows developers to override its default type inference through **type assertions**, commonly known as **type casting**. This feature is useful when you know more about a value’s type than TypeScript can infer.

### 4.1 Syntax for Type Assertions

There are two ways to perform type assertions in TypeScript:

1. **Angle-bracket syntax (`<Type>`):**
   “`typescript
   let someValue: any = "Hello, TypeScript!";
   let strLength: number = (# ##### ### <[string](https://)>someValue).length;

2. **`as` syntax:**

   ```typescript
   let someValue: any = "Hello, TypeScript!";
   let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
   ```

Both syntaxes achieve the same result, but the `as` syntax is preferred in modern TypeScript, especially when working with JSX (since JSX interprets `<...>` as an HTML tag).

### 4.2 Use Cases for Type Assertions

Type assertions are particularly useful in scenarios where TypeScript’s type inference falls short:

- **Working with the DOM:**  
  TypeScript might return a generic `Element` type when querying an HTML element, but you know it’s a more specific type.
  “`typescript
  let inputElement = document.getElementById("username") as HTMLInputElement;
  console.log(inputElement.value); // Now TypeScript knows this has a ‘value’ property.

- **Narrowing down `any` or `unknown` types:**  

  When dealing with dynamic data (e.g., API responses), type assertions help clarify the expected type.

  ```typescript
  let apiResponse: any = fetchData();
  let user = apiResponse as User; // Assume ‘User’ is a defined interface.
  ```

- **When TypeScript inference is too broad:**  
  Sometimes, TypeScript provides a less specific type than what is needed.

  ```typescript
  let canvas = document.querySelector("canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
  let context = canvas.getContext("2d"); // TypeScript now recognizes this as a 'CanvasRenderingContext2D'.
  ```

### 4.3 Limitations of Type Assertions

While type assertions are powerful, they do not perform any runtime checks. They only instruct TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type. If the statement is incorrect, it may lead to runtime errors:

“`typescript
let someValue: any = 42;
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length; // Runtime error: ‘length’ does not exist on number

To avoid such issues, developers should use type assertions carefully and ensure the actual value matches the asserted type.

5.Union and Intersection Types
In TypeScript, **Union Types** and **Intersection Types** provide powerful ways to define flexible and expressive type constraints. These features help developers create type-safe structures that accommodate multiple possible values or combine properties from different types.  

#### 5.1 Union Types  

A **Union Type** allows a variable to hold values of multiple types. It is declared using the `|` (pipe) operator. This is particularly useful when working with values that can be one of several types.  

##### Example: Basic Union Type  

```typescript
let value: string | number;
value = "Hello"; // ✅ Valid
value = 42;      // ✅ Valid
value = true;    // ❌ Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
```  

Here, `value` can hold either a `string` or a `number`, but not both simultaneously.  

##### Example: Union Types in Function Parameters  

```typescript
function displayId(id: string | number) {
  console.log(`ID: ${id}`);
}

displayId(101);      // ✅ Works with number
displayId("ABC123"); // ✅ Works with string
```

Union types are commonly used in function parameters to allow flexibility while maintaining type safety.  

##### Narrowing Union Types  

TypeScript provides **type narrowing** to work safely with union types using type guards like `typeof` or `instanceof`.  

```typescript
function processValue(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe to use string methods
  } else {
    console.log(value.toFixed(2)); // Safe to use number methods
  }
}
```

#### 5.2 Intersection Types  

An **Intersection Type** combines multiple types into one. A variable of an intersection type must satisfy all combined types. It is declared using the `&` (ampersand) operator.  

##### Example: Basic Intersection Type  

```typescript
type User = { name: string; age: number };
type Employee = { employeeId: number; department: string };

type EmployeeDetails = User & Employee;

const emp: EmployeeDetails = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  employeeId: 12345,
  department: "Engineering"
};
```

Here, `EmployeeDetails` must have all properties from `User` and `Employee`. This ensures that an object has all required fields from the intersected types.  

##### Example: Intersection Types in Function Parameters  

```typescript
function printEmployeeDetails(emp: User & Employee) {
  console.log(`${emp.name}, Age: ${emp.age}, ID: ${emp.employeeId}, Dept: ${emp.department}`);
}

printEmployeeDetails(emp);
```

#### 5.3 Union vs. Intersection Types  

| Feature          | Union Type (`|`) | Intersection Type (`&`) |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Meaning        | Accepts one of the types | Combines all properties of types |
| Example       | `string | number` (either a string or a number) | `{name: string} & {age: number}` (must have both properties) |
| Use Case       | When a value can be one of multiple types | When an object must satisfy multiple type requirements |

#### 5.4 Key Takeaways  

- **Union Types (`|`)** allow a variable to be one of several types.  
- **Intersection Types (`&`)** combine multiple types into a single type with all their properties.  
- **Type narrowing** is necessary to work with union types safely.  
- **Intersection types** enforce stricter typing, ensuring all required properties exist.  

By leveraging union and intersection types, developers can write more flexible, type-safe TypeScript code while ensuring maintainability and correctness.

6.Conclusion
